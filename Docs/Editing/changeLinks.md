### How to change the links content:
1. Open the `index.html` file.
2. From lines `43 - 69` you will find the links content.
3. Replace the link inside the `<a href>` tag with your desired link:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- For example: line `43` replace `<a href="https://github.com"` with `<a href="https://YOURLINK.com"`

4. Then edit the text content on the same line right BEFORE the `</a>` tag:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- For example: line `43` replace `GitHub` with the name of the site you linked.

5. Repeat for all the links you want to change, then save `index.html` and refresh the page.

### If that did not work:
1. Make sure your running your own version of Inception locally the url should point to the file saved on your local machine.
2. Make sure the link in the `a href` tag has `"`'s wrapped around it.
3. If none of the above worked, open an issue [here](https://github.com/antonio-hickey/Inception/issues/new) and I will assist you with the issue.
