### How to change the color's:
1. Open a color picker ([here](https://www.colorpicker.me)) and pick out 3 colors for your dark theme, and 3 colors for your light theme, but they can be the same 3 colors if you want.
2. Open `style.css` file in `assets/styles` folder
3. Swap colors1-3 with your color's on lines `2-4` for the dark theme and on lines `13-15` for the light theme. This part may take some trail and error so save the `style.css` file and refresh the page after every change. 
4. * Hint: try to match the color's with your art for the best appeal. Don't be afraid to spend a few minutes trying out different color's you will find a nice match eventually!
5. * Optional you can edit what elements take what color from the `style.css` file, but that's outside the scope of this document.

### If that did not work:
1. Make sure your running your own version of Inception locally the url should point to the file saved on your local machine.
2. Make sure your colors include a `#` at the start
3. Make sure the file path you're providing to `src` is wrapped in `"`'s
4. If none of the above worked, open an issue [here](https://github.com/antonio-hickey/Inception/issues/new) and I will assist you with the issue.
