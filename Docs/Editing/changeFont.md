### How to change the font:
1. Find a font you like, you can use https://fonts.google.com/ select the style then copy the link it gives you on the right should look similar to this `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans:wght@300&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">` for example.
2. Open `index.html` and go to line `7`, and replace the default link with the link you just copied, then save the file.
3. Open `style.css` inside the `assets/styles` folder, and go to line `25` and replace the default font name with your font name, then save the file.
4. Refresh the page.

### If that did not work:
1. Make sure your running your own version of Inception locally the url should point to the file saved on your local machine.
2. Make sure you followed BOTH steps 2-3.
3. Make sure the font link you put in `index.html` look's similar to the example in step 1.
4. If none of the above worked, open an issue [here](https://github.com/antonio-hickey/Inception/issues/new) and I will assist you with the issue.
