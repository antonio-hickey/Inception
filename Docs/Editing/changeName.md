## How to change the name of the welcome message:

![](https://github.com/antonio-hickey/Inception/blob/main/assets/images/Doc%20Gifs/editName.gif)

#### This one is easy !
1. Open the `index.html` file.
2. On line `22` you will find the welcome message.
3. Replace `Antonio` with your name or replace the message entirely.
4. Reload the page, and you should see the change!

#### If that did not work:
1. Make sure your running your own version of Inception locally
   the url should point to the file saved on your local machine.
2. If you're just replacing the name make sure line `22` is:
   `<h1 class="title">Welcome YOUR NAME!</h1>`
3. If none of the above worked, open an issue [here](https://github.com/antonio-hickey/Inception/issues/new)
   and I will assist you with the issue.
