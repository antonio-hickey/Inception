### How to change the art:
1. Find an image you want, ideally around 300 width x 500 height or you can edit the dimension's yourself using an editor.
2. Place the image in the `assets/images/` folder and copy the name of the image file.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- For example: My custom image will be named `custom.png` (`jpg` files also work)

3. Open `index.html` and go to line 20.
4. Replace `default.png` with `custom.png` or `YOURIMAGENAME.png` and save the file, then refresh the page.

### If that did not work:
1. Make sure your running your own version of Inception locally the url should point to the file saved on your local machine.
2. Make sure the image file is in the `assets/images/` folder and the image name is correct (CaSe SeNsItIvE)
3. Make sure the file path you're providing to `src` is wrapped in `"`'s
4. If none of the above worked, open an issue [here](https://github.com/antonio-hickey/Inception/issues/new) and I will assist you with the issue.
